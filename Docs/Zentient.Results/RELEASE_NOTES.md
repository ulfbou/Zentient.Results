# **Zentient.Results 0.4.4**

We are pleased to announce the release of **Zentient.Results, version 0.4.4**, a patch update focused on further enhancing the robustness, consistency, and internal clarity of `Result` object creation and error handling. This release builds upon the foundational improvements introduced in previous versions, particularly refining how errors and messages are managed within the core `Result` types.

## **What's New in 0.4.4**

This version introduces the following key improvements:

  * **Refined Error and Message Handling in `Result<T>`:**

      * The `Failure` factory methods for `Result<T>` have been improved to ensure that messages derived from `ErrorInfo` objects, as well as those from exceptions in `FromException`, are consistently captured and added to the `Result.Messages` collection. This provides a more comprehensive and predictable view of all associated messages.
      * Standardized the use of `default(T)` across `Result<T>` failure factory methods for improved type consistency and clarity.

  * **Enhanced Test Coverage and Validation:**

      * Updated existing tests and added new ones in `ResultTTests.cs` and `ResultTests.cs` to explicitly verify the correct propagation of error messages and the handling of null/empty error collections.
      * Refined assertions in tests, specifically for `ErrorInfo.Metadata`, to correctly expect an empty collection rather than a null value.
      * Adjusted expected exception types in tests to accurately reflect current argument validation behavior (e.g., `ArgumentNullException` for null error collections).

  * **Codebase Clean-up and Consistency:**

      * Removed unnecessary Byte Order Mark (BOM) characters from `Result{T}.cs`, `ResultStatusTests.cs`, `ResultTTests.cs`, and `ResultTests.cs` for minor encoding detail improvements.
      * Removed `FromHttpStatusCode` tests from `ResultStatusTests.cs` to align with the removal of the corresponding method from `ResultStatus`, ensuring tests reflect the current API.
      * Made minor adjustments to the implicit conversion test in `ResultTTests.cs` for explicit clarity.

## **Important Notes**

  * **Patch Release:** This is a **patch version** and introduces **no new breaking changes** to the public API of `Zentient.Results` beyond those already present in version 0.4.0.
  * **0.4.0 Breaking Changes Still Apply:** If you are upgrading from a version older than 0.4.0, please ensure your code has been adjusted for the significant breaking changes introduced in **Zentient.Results 0.4.0** (e.g., `Result` and `Result<T>` as sealed classes, `IResult.Error` renamed to `IResult.ErrorMessage`, `ErrorInfo.Metadata` consolidation). This 0.4.4 release does not revert or modify those changes.
  * **Feedback Welcome**: Your feedback is crucial for the continued improvement of Zentient.Results. Please report any issues, suggest improvements, or share your usage experiences by opening an issue on our GitHub repository.
